/*
Dial's algorithm
We can extend this even further if we allow the weights of the edges to be even bigger.
If every edge in the graph has a weight â‰¤k, than the distances of vertices in the queue will differ by at most k 
from the distance of v to the source. So we can keep k+1 buckets for the vertices in the queue, and whenever the bucket 
corresponding to the smallest distance gets empty, we make a cyclic shift to get the bucket with the next higher distance.
This extension is called Dial's algorithm.
