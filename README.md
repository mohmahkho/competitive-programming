# MohMahKho's Competitive Programming Library
In this repository I try to maintain a library of algorithms and data structures that are regularly used in competitive programming.

### Requirements & Assumptions
- It is assumed that all the standard library headers are included (```#include <bits/stdc++.h>```)
- To be strict, source codes require c++-17 standard to compile (although in many cases lower standards suffice)
- Some compiler specific functions may have been used (e.g. ```__builtin_popcount```). To avoid any trouble, use ```g++```
- Most of the codes have been stress tested.

More recent codes are stylistically different (e.g. no global variable or using more lambdas).

Just testing:
$$
1 = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p_\xi(x)dx
$$
