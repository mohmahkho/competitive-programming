/*
Reading input usually is not a problem, but sometimes we need to be careful.
for example assume that we are going to read a grid from input and we need to take
n and m which are number of rows and colums of grid respectively.
usually the input first contains number of rows then number of columns, but in some rare
cases the input streams first contains number of columns then number of rows. this can be very hard
to debug because you don't see a bug! so read the problem statement carefully!
